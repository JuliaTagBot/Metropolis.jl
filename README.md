# Metropolis
A package implementing the Metropolis and related algorithms for generalized monte carlo integration and simulated annealing.  The ultimate goal is to have a
package capable of efficiently computing lattice gauge theory integrals, but which still retains enough generality to have wide applicability.

So far this is extremely rough and experimental.
